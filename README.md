# Program-Launcher
This Program stores program names and file paths to launch them. It is designed to have a single place to launch programs from that have 
their own launchers. For example: video games where you need to open steam for one, origin for another, battle.net for another etc... 
Using this they can instead be launched from one program.

This was made using C# in visual studio with a Microsoft SQL server to store the program names and paths.
